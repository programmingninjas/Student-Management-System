# Student-Management-System
Student Management System using Python with Tkinter. This is a simple management system where you can ADD a student and DELETE a student from the Database. I have connected to mySQL database. You are asked to use your MySql password in the code as per your database connection. Here I have included a SECRET LOGIN SYSTEM which can only be accessed by the admin. On opening the application press "007 + Space Bar"(Code for the secret login) and the admin window will be opened where you can add information of the student , Add a student and DELETE a student. In the login window a student can see his details by using his/her name as ```Username``` and ```Admission number``` as his password.
